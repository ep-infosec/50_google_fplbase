To build these samples,
  for Android:
    from the root project directory,
    ../fplutil/bin/build_all_android -f "APP_ABI=armeabi-v7a" -S -i -r
    results are in apks dir

  for others:
     simply build the root FPLBase CMakeLists.txt,
     not the ones in this directory or below.

For more information, see "Building" in the documentation.
